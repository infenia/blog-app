# Slack Integration Setup

This guide will help you set up Slack notifications for contact form submissions.

## Step 1: Create a Slack Workspace (If You Don't Have One)

1. Go to [Slack](https://slack.com/)
2. Sign in or create a new workspace

## Step 2: Create a Slack Channel

1. In your Slack workspace, create a new channel for contact form submissions
   - Click the **+** button next to "Channels"
   - Name it something like `#contact-form` or `#website-inquiries`
   - Make it public or private based on your needs

## Step 3: Create a Slack App

1. Go to [Slack API Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click **Create New App**
3. Select **From scratch**
4. Enter App Name: `Contact Form Notifications` (or any name)
5. Select your workspace
6. Click **Create App**

## Step 4: Enable Incoming Webhooks

1. In your app settings, click **Incoming Webhooks** in the left sidebar
2. Toggle **Activate Incoming Webhooks** to **On**
3. Scroll down and click **Add New Webhook to Workspace**
4. Select the channel you created in Step 2 (e.g., `#contact-form`)
5. Click **Allow**

## Step 5: Copy the Webhook URL

1. You'll see a **Webhook URL** that looks like:
   ```
   https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
   ```
2. Click **Copy** to copy this URL

## Step 6: Configure Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env.local` file in your project root (if it doesn't exist)
2. Add the webhook URL:

```env
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL
```

Replace `YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL` with the actual webhook URL you copied.

## Step 7: Test the Integration

1. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. Go to your website and fill out the contact form
3. Submit the form
4. Check your Slack channel - you should see a nicely formatted message with:
   - üì© Header
   - Email address
   - Date and time
   - Message content

## Message Format

The Slack message will look like this:

```
üì© New Contact Form Submission

Email:                    Date:
user@example.com          1/15/2025, 3:45:23 PM

Message:
This is a test message from the contact form.
_________________________________
```

## Troubleshooting

### No messages appearing in Slack

1. ‚úÖ Check that `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` is set correctly in `.env.local`
2. ‚úÖ Verify the webhook URL is active (go to your Slack App settings)
3. ‚úÖ Make sure you selected the correct channel when creating the webhook
4. ‚úÖ Check the browser console and server logs for errors

### Error: "Failed to send message to Slack"

1. The webhook URL might be incorrect - copy it again from Slack
2. The webhook might have been revoked - create a new one
3. Check your internet connection

### Want to change the channel?

1. Go to your [Slack App settings](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Click on your app
3. Go to **Incoming Webhooks**
4. Delete the old webhook
5. Create a new webhook pointing to a different channel
6. Update your `.env.local` with the new URL

## Customizing the Message

You can customize the Slack message format by editing `src/app/actions.ts`. The message uses Slack's Block Kit format.

## Security Notes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit `.env.local` to version control
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Keep your webhook URL secret - anyone with it can post to your Slack channel
- ‚úÖ Add `.env.local` to your `.gitignore` file

## Advanced: Multiple Channels

If you want to send to multiple channels:

1. Create multiple webhooks (one per channel)
2. Add them all to your `.env.local`:
   ```env
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/AAA/BBB/CCC
   SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL_BACKUP=https://hooks.slack.com/services/DDD/EEE/FFF
   ```
3. Update `actions.ts` to send to both webhooks
